Let's install and configure shadcn/ui in our Next.js project. we'll need several components include

Can you help me set this up?

We need the light/dark mode support, using the best and most  popular Next.js solution for that.

Help me create Kanban-style board layout using shadcnui and Tailwind.

I want three columns  Todo, In progress, Done.

Each  column should be able to display task cards.

You have removed the light/dark mode toggling. Please bring it back.

You have removed the light/dark mode toggling. please bring it back. Make sure you use the existing component:

@theme-provider.tsx and @theme-toggle.tsx

Can you explain this to me, as if I don't know  React?

Update TaskCard  component using shadcn /ui.

Each card  should display title, description, assignee.

it should have an option to edit the  asssignee.

Make it look professional. Install midding components.

Help me implement a task creation/editing dialog using shadcn Dialog and From components.

We need fields for title, description, assignee,.

Include the client side validation using  Zod.

I'd like to use React Hook Form.

Take a look at the @TaskCard.tsx for how a task looks like.

 We're missing a way to open this dialog to create a new task.

There's no way to open the dialog for editing an existing task.

Please use dropdown inside eaxh task, that will have an "Edit" option.

Additionally, it seems that we're missing  some components that are required by @TaskDialog.tsx 

I need a list of "static" assginees for the tasks.

This would eventually be fetched from the db.

For now, put this in a *.ts file. put in the right place.

The assignees need avatars. Can we grab some avatar faces over the internet?

Please also repalce USERS const with this new assigness where needed!

Please fix this error.

We need to setup a database that will keep  the data for this project.
Let's store columns & tasks in db.

Use Postgres for db & drizzle for the ORM.

For now, setup the docker compose file for  Postgres, and drizzle connectiuon setup etc.

Don't touch the React components or pages yet.

why did you suggest a vercel library? Is it essential?

I've just dowmloade Docker Desktop for Mac, and this is what I get when I run that command.

What could the problem be, please suggest the best solution for this issue.

So I run docker compose up -d, and still failed. What about the PATH


only do those points below, NOTHING ELSE!

1) We dont have an src folder, so move everything into lib one
2) Next up, we seem not to have .env file and additionally, let's just use DB_URL, not separate env vars
3) Use @docker-compose.yml for credentials
4) for @drizzle.config.ts use format instead:

import { defineConfig } from "drizzle-kit";  export default defineConfig({   schema: "./schema/*",   out: "./drizzle",   dialect: 'postgresql',   dbCredentials: {     url: process.env.DB_URL,   } });  for reference use: @https://orm.drizzle.team/drizzle-studio/overview  

5)  Fix the @config.ts  to use the DB_URL as well


With this setup @docker-compose.yml how do i make sure, that  teamtasks database is created? And if I don't have that database, how do I create one ?

We need to fetch columns & tasks.

This should achieved through:
- It's  Next.js so use Server Components when possible.
- Use Server actions when possible
- Use Next.js 15

For now only handle the column & task fetching, storing/updating/deleting - this should ignored for now.

Make sure not to use useEffect.

You generated markup with Tailwind, but you should use existing components lik @KanbanBoard.tsx and @TaskCard.tsx - so just modify them if necessary

Introduce the artifical delay, maybe 3 seconds make it configurable in a constant.

The page needs a loading state for the columns and tasks.

Use Next.js  best practices for loading state, but keep it simple.

Use shadcn/ui Skeleton component and try to match the potential look of teamtasks columns & tasks ideally.

So in @KanbanBoard.tsx  you've added some strange API that's not necessary only leave the data fetching that was there with Promise all.

The loading state should be display using loading.tsx.

Also, the skeleton component is not installed.

write onTaskCreate  function in @KanbanBoard.tsx for  do possible event task create in  into any kanban column

The theme toggle was removed, please add it back - we're talking about this components @theme-toggle.tsx

I'd like to store the new task. there's the @TaskDialog.tsx . Please create a server action that will store a new task. There's already the client side validation, but please reuse the same schema on the backend and validate the task again inside the server action.

Please also simplify the  flow, so that the task is stored immediatelly, and we don't pass so many event handlers through components.

1) @createTask() action needs to actually store data inside the db. We've got the drizzle setup, so use that.
Make sure to return meaningful things, so that potential errors can be handled in the form.

2) Make sure we put all the ZOD schemas into 1 single file, wich would be accisble by both server and client side components. So that we can reuse all schemas easily.

So @taskFormSchema should be used in both @createTask() and inside the @TaskDialog.tsx form.

The schema needs to change. Remove priority and dueDate and add the columnId, based on @tasks

Don't add the order to the ZOD schema, as it will be generated later.

Don't do anything else I didn't ask for.

Remove the @taskFormSchema and just use one schema always, defined in @schema.ts

Every @TaskDialog.tsx needs to get the columnId as a prop.
we need to know, to which column we're adding a task.

it should be passed as a prop from @kanban-column.tsx and it needs to  receive it from @kanban-board.tsx 

And then, this columnId needs to be part of the form inside @TaskDialog.tsx instead of assigneeId

Finally, in the @createTask() make sure you pass the values for columns that should be passed, based on db shema: @tasks

Additionally, since order column should be caculated, you need to calculate it's value inside the @createTask()
